    <h3>Double Up</h3>
    <p>During a double up day votes are multiplied by two. These double ups run all day from <strong class="strong-alt">midnight
      to midnight</strong>. Any votes on the double up day counts twice!</p>
    <h3>Tripple Up</h3>
    <p>Tripple Ups run for 3 hours from <strong class="strong-alt">11H30 to 14H30</strong>. All votes received in a
      tripple up round are multiplied by three. Really get ahead with three times as many votes.</p>
    <h3>Quad Up</h3>
    <p>During Quad Up rounds all votes are multiplied by four. These are the holy grail of power up rounds. Quad Ups run
      for four hours from <strong class="strong-alt">11H00 to 15H00</strong>.</p>
