  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <h3>5. Publicity and Personal Information</h3>
  <p>
    5.1 The Promoter collects personal information (&quot;PI&quot;) in order to conduct the Competitions and may, for
    this purpose, disclose such PI to third parties, including but not limited to agents, contractors, service
    providers and prize suppliers. Entry is conditional on providing this PI. The Promoter will use and handle PI as
    outlined in the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2000, of 2013 (&quot;POPI&quot;).
  </p>
  <p>
    5.2 In addition to any use that may be outlined in the Promoter&#39;s Privacy Policy, the Promoter may, unless
    otherwise advised, use the PI for promotional, marketing, publicity, research and profiling purposes, including
    sending electronic messages via SMS or email or telephoning the entrant. The Promoter&#39;s Privacy Policy also
    contains information about how entrants may opt out, access, update or correct their PI, how entrants may complain
    about a breach of their PI or any other applicable law and how those complaints will be dealt with. All entries
    become the property of the Promoter. The Promoter will not disclose entrant&#39;s PI to any entity outside of
    South Africa, other than to those providers as discussed below, and subject to these General Terms and Privacy
    Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.3 All entrants may have their details removed from our database by contacting the Promoter. If details are
    removed prior to the conclusion of the Competition and/or award of prize(s), entrants will, however, forfeit their
    right to claim any prizes.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.4 It is a condition of entry to our Competitions that we have the right to publicise, broadcast and communicate
    to the public the names, home towns and characters of entrants to our Competitions for the running of the
    Competitions and matters incidental to the Competition.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.4 In particular, entrants consent to their entries to our Competitions being communicated to the public on our
    Website/s.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.5 All entrants, and particularly prize winners, may be required by us to participate in photo, recording, video
    and/or film session(s). In this regard, you agree that we shall have the right to use all the resulting publicity
    materials in any medium (including, without limitation, the internet) and in any manner we see fit, unless you
    advise us at the time of entering the Competition that you wish to retain your anonymity.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.6 Entrants also acknowledge that publicity materials featuring them may be provided to our third party prize
    providers for the purposes of promoting their association with the Competition and awarding the relevant
    prizes.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.7 No fees shall be payable by any entrant in relation to their entry in any Competition. Fees are applicable
    when voting in a Competition. See clause 3 above for more details on rates and charges for voting.
