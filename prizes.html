    <h2>Bonus Top Up</h2>
    <p>During some competitions there may be a bonus top up prize. The bonus top up, when it occurs, is a progressive
      prize added to the first place winnings. If a bonus top up is activated for a competition then each new vote in
      that
      competition adds an amount to the bonus top up.<br/>If, for instance, the bonus top up amount grows to R1243 and
      the
      first place prize is R5000, then the total first place winning will be R5000 + R1243 = R6243.</p>
    <h2>Voters Prize</h2>
    <p>Voters are entered into a draw to win a R2000 cash prize. Each vote is an entry into the draw so the more you
      vote
      the more your chances to win (eg, a 20 vote bundle gets you 20 entries into the draw).<br/><strong>NOTE: </strong>
      SMS voters are automatically entered. If you vote by credit card, paypal or snap scan you will need to <a
              href="/register-vote/">register your vote</a>.</p>
