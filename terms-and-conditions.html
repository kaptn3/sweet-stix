  <h3>3. Entry and Voting Methods</h3>

  <h4>3.1 Introduction:</h4>

  <p>
    Entry into the Competition is free, bar any costs charged by your mobile network service provider in enabling the
    entering or voting via SMS, but which charge is not levied nor collected by the Promoter. Voting via SMS in a
    Competition attracts a Premium rated charge from, and to the benefit of, the Promoter. Voting can be done by either
    sending a single SMS at a Premium rate or using a bundle package of 2&nbsp;votes at a Premium rate, as may be
    prescribed on the promoters website from time to time, per bundle or using a bundle package of 25 votes at a Premium
    rate, as may be prescribed on the promoters website from time to time, per bundle. There are no limits on the number
    of votes cast by a single voter. Voting can also be done via credit card, SnapScan and PayPal as well as over the
    counter at Shoprite and Checkers.
  </p>

  <h4>3.2 Premium rates:</h4>

  <p>
    Voting in a Competition is done by Premium rate mobile SMS, meaning that you will pay an additional fee to the
    Promoter on top of any charge levied by a third-party provider to utilise those services for entering, voting or
    using the Website (e.g. your mobile network provider). Your network provider may also charge varying amounts for
    these types of electronic communications and SMS&#39;s, where the total cost of your SMS may be more than as stated
    by us. In all cases, you should check with your network provider. Please note that invalid or unsuccessful votes
    made via these methods will still be charged for. In all cases, you should have the bill payer&#39;s permission to
    vote using a premium rate method, and to vote into any Competition generally. Where voting is by premium rate mobile
    SMS, votes that are submitted before or after the competition dates will not be counted in the Competition but
    entrants will still be charged for SMS&#39;s already sent. Votes that are submitted on or after&nbsp;an Knock-Out
    Day may not be considered if the entrant has been knocked-out but entrants will still be charged for SMS&#39;s
    already sent.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.3 SMS: Where a Competition asks you to vote using SMS; you will need an SMS compatible mobile phone with a valid
    account with a South African service provider that permits SMS messages to our premium rate mobile SMS number. SMS
    entries are deemed to be received on arrival, not when they are sent from your handset. SMS entries must be
    addressed to the correct short code and must include the correct Unique voting ID as required by the specific
    Competition. Entries which fail to do so will be void, but will still be charged for.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.4 Deficient entries: In all Competitions, we reserve the right to reject any entries that are incomplete,
    incomprehensible, damaged or otherwise deficient. We also reserve the right to reject entries that are unlawful,
    indecent, racist, inflammatory, defamatory or which we consider to be otherwise harmful to the goodwill and
    reputation of our website and the Competition in question. We accept no responsibility for any late, lost or
    misdirected entries, including but not limited to, texts, calls or emails not received due to technical disruptions,
    network congestion or any other reason. Proof of posting of any postal entry will not be proof of our receipt of
      that entry.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.5 Automated Entry: The use of any automated entry software or any other mechanical or electronic means that
      permits any person to enter any Competition repeatedly is prohibited.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.6 Names: Entrants must enter Competitions using their legal name once only. We reserve the right to disqualify any
      entrant who uses multiple names and to require them to return any prize they may have won.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.7 Multiple Entries: Unless otherwise permitted pursuant to any terms, no person may enter any Competition more
    than once and persons may not enter or participate as part of a syndicate or on behalf of any other person,
      syndicate, group, society or company.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.8 Prize Limits: No person or persons at the same residential address may win more than one prize valued at R1,000
      or more via any of our Competitions in any six (6) month period.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.9 Retrospective Effect: Where an entrant or prizewinner has been found to be in breach of any of the terms and
    conditions of a Competition and, in particular, where a person is in breach of the entry restrictions, we may
    nevertheless still enforce our right to disqualify that person and require the return or reimbursement to us of any
    prize, even where a prize has already been awarded and/or actually provided to the entrant or prizewinner in
    question.
